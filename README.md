# Rules of Breakthrough

* A piece may move one space straight or diagonally forward if the target square is empty.
* A piece may remove an opponent's piece if the opponent's piece is in a square that is one step diagonally forward.

### There are 3 ways to determine winning state:
* The first player to reach the opponent's home row is the winner.
* If all the pieces of a player are captured, that player loses.
* A draw is impossible.
